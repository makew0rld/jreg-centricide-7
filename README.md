# Jreg Centricide 7 Community Map

This GitHub repository contains code that generates graphs of the Jreg Centricide 7 relationships. This is notable because these graphs can be edited and improved by the community. *You* can propose changes or file bug reports if you realize that this graph is incorrect. **Best of all, it contains hyperlinks to each video.**

The code lives in [`main.gv`](./main.gv) file, it is written in the [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) format. You should get the hang of it by looking at the file contents.


## Latest graphs

The actual generated graphs live here. You can freely link to them, to put them on your website, Reddit post, whatever. They are in PDF and SVG format, because they contain hyperlinks.

The filenames start with either `dot` or `neato`. Those names refer to different algorithms. Basically, `dot` will look more hierarchical, and `neato` will be more circular.
